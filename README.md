# Brain Tumor Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of brain tumors in MRI images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model can classify MRI scans as either showing the presence of a tumor or being tumor-free.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
You can use the trained model in two ways:

Jupyter Notebook: Open train_model.ipynb to explore the model training and evaluation process.
Streamlit App: Run the Streamlit app to interactively upload MRI images and get predictions.
Running the Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
streamlit run app.py
